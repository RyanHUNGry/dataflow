## Introduction

**dataflow** is a specialized issue tracker designed to streamline and enhance your data science and data analysis projects. The platform offers a unique approach to project management through the concept of **flows**, while also providing an array of additional features tailored to empower your data-related tasks. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or enthusiast, dataflow is here to optimize your workflow.

Please note that the current development is focused on the backend, core infrastructure, and internal tooling. A frontend won't be released in the near future. As such, this repository will document application infrastructure, APIs, and other related concepts.
