## Introduction

**dataflow** is a specialized issue tracker designed to streamline and enhance your data science and data analysis projects. The platform offers a unique approach to project management through the concept of **flows**, while also providing an array of additional features tailored to empower your data-related tasks. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or enthusiast, dataflow is here to optimize your workflow.

Please consider that current development is focused on the backend, core infrastructure, and internal developer tooling. A frontend won't be released in the near future. As such, this repository will document application infrastructure, APIs, and other related concepts.

## Installation

### Dependencies

1. Clone the repository and install backend dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/RyanHUNGry/dataflow.git && cd ./dataflow/backend && npm install

# install from root directory
git clone https://github.com/RyanHUNGry/dataflow.git && cd ./dataflow && npm start --prefix backend
```

2. Create an environment variables file:
```shell
cd backend && touch.env
```

3. Fill out the following environment variables inside `.env`:
```bash
NODE_ENV=...

PG_DEV_DATABASE=...
PG_DEV_USERNAME=...
PG_DEV_PASSWORD=...

DEV_PORT=...

DEV_JWT_SECRET=...

AWS_PUBLIC_KEY:...
AWS_SECRET_KEY:...
```

### Starting a Server
1. Start a server on default `http://localhost:8000`:
```shell
npm start

# run nodemon process for development
npm run watch
```

2. Ping the API with a tool such as [Postman](https://www.google.com/search?q=postman&oq=Postman&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512l2j69i64j0i433i512j0i512l3j5.1765j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
